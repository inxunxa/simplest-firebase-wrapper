# simplest-firebase-wrapper
This is a really simple firebase wrapper I just created to use Firebase and VueJS, but can easy be used with any other framework (or none at all).

## Basic idea
- To initialize the connections, and pass a list that will be updated with (the specified) firebase tree, auto managing the child_added, child_changed and child_removed events from firebase.
- Provide easy to use, easy to remember method names to  async usage of database storage.
